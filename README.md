##  Overview

This project investigates and compares four advanced techniques **Method of Lines (MOL)**, **Finite Volume Method (FVM)**, **Finite Element Method (FEM)**, and **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve a nonlinear system of coupled PDEs modeling drug diffusion and mechanical stress in polymeric tissues.

## Problem Description

We consider a bio-mathematical model for drug release involving three dependent variables:

- u(x,t) ‚Üí Unbound (free) drug  
- v(x,t) ‚Üí Bound drug  
- œÉ(x,t) ‚Üí Stress in the polymer matrix  

The model incorporates **nonlinear binding kinetics**, **diffusion**, and **stress coupling**. Governing equations:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + E \frac{\partial^2 \sigma}{\partial x^2} + f(u, v)
$$

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = g(u, v)
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \sigma}{\partial t} = \alpha u - \beta \sigma + \gamma \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
$$

##  Numerical Methods

###  Method of Lines (MOL)
- Spatial discretization via finite differences  
- Temporal integration using *LSODA*  
- Good accuracy, but relatively *computationally expensive*

###  Finite Volume Method (FVM)
- Volume-integrated discretization with central-difference fluxes  
- Robin boundary conditions implemented  
- Conservative and physically grounded, but slightly less accurate

###  Finite Element Method (FEM)
- Weak form via linear elements  
- Mass and stiffness matrix formulation  
- *Best trade-off* between accuracy and runtime

###  PINNs (Physics-Informed Neural Networks)
- Mesh-free neural network model  
- Trained to minimize residuals of PDEs + initial/boundary loss  
- Promising deep learning alternative, but training-sensitive

##  PINN Architecture

- 8 hidden layers, 100 neurons each  
- tanh activation, Xavier initialization  
- Adaptive loss weighting schedule  
- Trained with Adam optimizer (lr = 0.0008) for 3000 epochs  

---

##  Conclusions

- *FEM* outperformed other numerical methods in both *accuracy and efficiency*
- *PINNs* are a flexible future path, requiring tuning and more resources  
- FVM shows strong conservation but needs higher-order schemes to match FEM

---

##  Future Directions

- Upgrade MOL with adaptive or higher-order schemes  
- Extend FEM to 2D/3D geometries  
- Introduce TVD/flux-limiter techniques for FVM  
- Improve PINNs via dynamic loss weighting and physics-informed regularization
