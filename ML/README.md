<h1 align="center">Modeling Drug Release with Physics-Informed Neural Network</h1>

## overview:
This part of the project uses PINNs to solve a coupled system of 3 PDEs:

u(x,t): Unbound drug concentration

v(x,t): Bound drug concentration

Ïƒ(x,t): Polymer stress

## Drug Release Dynamics and Mass Conservation Analysis:
We track the evolution of unbound, bound, and total drug concentrations, along with polymer stress, over time. The model shows accurate dynamic behavior and captures key physical trends. Additionally, we assess mass conservation by comparing total drug content at different time points, observing expected losses and quantifying conservation error.

  </p>
  
  This figure shows the evolution of key loss components during training:
  
- **Initial condition losses** (for \( u \), \( v \), and \( \sigma \)) gradually decrease, confirming correct initialization.
- **PDE residual losses** decline across all three equations, reflecting improved physics compliance.
- **Total weighted loss** drops sharply, indicating successful convergence.
- **Learning rate** decay is plotted to show the adaptive schedule.
- **Physical balance metric** confirms that the model maintains a reasonable balance between physics and data constraints throughout training.

### 2. PDE Compliance and Spatio-Temporal Behavior:

  </p>
  
**2.1 Figure Breakdown:**
  
**Upper half**: Residual heatmaps of the three governing PDEs show how well the model satisfies the physical equations across space and time.  
**Lower half**: Spatio-temporal evolution of unbound drug \( u(x,t) \), bound drug \( v(x,t) \), and stress \( s(x,t) \).  

- \( u \): diffuses and binds over time, decreasing steadily.
- \( v \): increases and saturates.
- \( s \): initially zero, then rises and fades, forming a bell-like spatial shape.

**2.2 Residual Statistics Summary**

Here are the residual magnitudes for the learned PDEs, evaluating how well the trained PINN model satisfies the equations.

| PDE Component       | Max Residual | Mean Residual |
|---------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Unbound \( u \)** | 0.0728       | 0.0082         |
| **Bound \( v \)**   | 0.0170       | 0.0018         |
| **Stress \( s \)**  | 0.0309       | 0.0048         |

</p>

**Figure breakdown:**

- **Upper half:** Spatio-temporal behavior of:
  - \( u(x,t) \): Unbound drug, which diffuses and binds, decreasing over time.
  - \( v(x,t) \): Bound drug, which increases then saturates due to equilibrium binding.
  - \( s(x,t) \): Polymer stress, which forms a symmetric shape, rising then fading.

- **Lower half:** Temporal profiles at the center point \( x = 0 \):
  - \( u(0,t) \): Declines as it diffuses and reacts.
  - \( v(0,t) \): Rises quickly then levels off.
  - \( s(0,t) \): Starts at zero, increases with drug activity, then stabilizes.
